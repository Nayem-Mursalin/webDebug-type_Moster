                    <h5>What is the difference between Local Storage vs. Session Storage?</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The main difference between local storage and session storage is the data stored in localStorage
                        persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and
                        future visits to the site. For sessionStorage, changes are only available per tab. Changes made
                        are saved and available for the current page in that tab until it is closed. Once it is closed,
                        the stored data is deleted.

                    <h5>What is the difference between Global Scope and block Scope in Javascript?</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Global Scope means it can be decleared and access a variable anywhere in the program. But for
                        block scope we can access the variable only in this block where we decleared the variable.

                    <h5>How JavaScript event loop Works?</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the
                        Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to
                        the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

                    <h5>How can We get Undefined in Javascript?</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        If we decleare a variable but don't assign it's value than it is of type undefined.
